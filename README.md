# lathe_automation

This project focuses on adding a stepper motor–driven feed system to a manual lathe in order to automate longitudinal feed and enable precise control of cutting operations.

## 🚀 Project Goals

Automate the lathe’s feed using a stepper motor

Allow the user to set and adjust feed speed digitally

Enable thread cutting using controlled, synchronized feed motion

Improve repeatability and surface finish during turning operations

## 🔧 Overview

The system replaces the manual feed mechanism with a stepper motor controlled by a microcontroller. By adjusting motor speed and step resolution, the user can achieve consistent feed rates and perform threading without relying on traditional gearbox settings.

## 📌 Features (planned / implemented)

Electronic feed control

Adjustable feed rate

Automatic threading capability

User interface for selecting feed and thread parameters
